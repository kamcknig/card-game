TODO lower priority
- undo
- "set aside" area and update the one ability that uses it right now.
    maybe "arbitrary zones"
        if so then current zones can be converted to use the feature too.
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping
- create a "card display" component. this component can be used within things like the userPromptModal or reactModal.
- need to allow user to select another username inorder to see their discard?

TODO higher priority
- make some selections non-toggleable like when playing throne room and picking a card
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- end game - make a sound and maybe prompt to go to end game screen


when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)
