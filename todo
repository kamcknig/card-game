TODO lower priority
- undo turn/steps
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping

TODO higher priority
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)

update user prompt modal when there are multiple actions to toggle those actions (example pawn card in intrigue or courtier)

when select card effect happens, the UI needs to remove the play all treasure cards button

when player disconnects in game, give option to kick, or continue playing

select card effect handler tries to find cards before prompting user and if none, then returns empty array. 
 - look into making user prompt effect handler do the same

SEASIDE expansion - i haven't built outpost - taking an extra turn. the rules are so incredibly complicated it's jus tnot worth it right now.

ALCHEMY expansion - haven't built posession

set aside needs to be visible to all players

set aside - face down cards like with haven

for cards like charaltan in prosoperity that change cards need a way to display that change in the UI

need to go through eveyr reaction and make sure they are being cleaned up on their own DONE
 - then need to remove the `cleanupTriggers` method in reaciton manager- DONE
   - this method is messing up global reactions like peddlers
     - maybe need to look into system of automatic unregistering as well as manual.
     - system should accoutnt for duration rules 

reveal game action should always move card
  - so also need to make sure all card effects using it are moving cards back

curse cards - are they subtracting points?

cornucopia new features
 - young witch card - she adds a kingdom card. this card could trigger further setup. but most setup is configured
currently in order at the start of the match. so if it were to add a card from an expansion that had already
run its configurator, then that new card wouldn't be set up properly
