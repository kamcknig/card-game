TODO lower priority
- undo
- "set aside" area and update the one ability that uses it right now.
    maybe "arbitrary zones"
        if so then current zones can be converted to use the feature too.
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping
- create a "card display" component. this component can be used within things like the userPromptModal or reactModal.
- need to allow user to select another username inorder to see their discard?

TODO higher priority
- make some selections non-toggleable like when playing throne room and picking a card
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)

when playing treasures if you manually play them all the play treasure button doesn't disappear

use harbinger to test select card prompt with multiple cards in discard

validationButton for select prompot hass bee set to required so that you can find the places where you need to set it for card selection
