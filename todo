TODO lower priority
- undo
- "set aside" area and update the one ability that uses it right now.
    maybe "arbitrary zones"
        if so then current zones can be converted to use the feature too.
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping
- create a "card display" component. this component can be used within things like the userPromptModal or reactModal.
- need to allow user to select another username inorder to see their discard?

TODO higher priority
- make some selections non-toggleable like when playing throne room and picking a card
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- end game - make a sound and maybe prompt to go to end game screen





harbinger doesn't allow pressing done - i suspect the entire modal regardless of card won't allow it

cards like militia don't tell the player what to do

play treasures button shows when no treasures in hand see screenshot on laptop

if play treasure button is visiblwe and you end turn, it stays visible as it discards and draws new cards

looks like game scoring on game over screen doesn't sort winner properly - see screenshot on laptop
