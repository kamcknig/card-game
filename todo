TODO lower priority
- undo
- "set aside" area and update the one ability that uses it right now.
    maybe "arbitrary zones"
        if so then current zones can be converted to use the feature too.
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping
- create a "card display" component. this component can be used within things like the userPromptModal or reactModal.
- need to allow user to select another username inorder to see their discard?

TODO higher priority
- make some selections non-toggleable like when playing throne room and picking a card
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)


card expansion module's scoring functions currently only look in the hand, discard, deck. what about the play area? what about other random areas later? probably need to add an ownerId to Card class and then just look at all cards and their owners

update user prompt modal when there are multiple actions to toggle those actions (example pawn card in intrigue or courtier)

need to go through all effects. anything that is related to cost like choosing a card that costs x amount - need to update those to compare aginst the effective cost

viewing the trash sucks

supply is lumped in with all kingdom cards in the carddata so it can be cchosen in the kingdom

in normal dominion when someone else discards, does it tell you what the card is?

sentry prompt says to trash, but then asks to rearrange

deck and discard show counts - should they?

sentry - might be broken
