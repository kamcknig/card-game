TODO lower priority
- undo turn/steps
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping

TODO higher priority
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)

update user prompt modal when there are multiple actions to toggle those actions (example pawn card in intrigue or courtier)

when select card effect happens, the UI needs to remove the play all treasure cards button

when player disconnects in game, give option to kick, or continue playing

select card effect handler tries to find cards before prompting user and if none, then returns empty array. 
 - look into making user prompt effect handler do the same

SEASIDE expansion - i haven't built outpost - taking an extra turn. the rules are so incredibly complicated it's jus tnot worth it right now.
