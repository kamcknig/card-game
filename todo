TODO lower priority
- undo
- "set aside" area and update the one ability that uses it right now.
    maybe "arbitrary zones"
        if so then current zones can be converted to use the feature too.
- when can't load assets (expansion modules) it still just goes on rather than stopping
- need to allow user to select another username in order to see their discard?
- when discarding, the last card discarded should be displayed in log

TODO higher priority
- ask to resign feature
  - remove player that resigns - or just make them skip their turn each time
- when disconnecting/reconnecting, need to handle scenarios when waiting on input from the user that disconnected (from card effects - like the user prompt, or select card effects)


card expansion module's scoring functions currently only look in the hand, discard, deck. what about the play area? what about other random areas later? probably need to add an ownerId to Card class and then just look at all cards and their owners

update user prompt modal when there are multiple actions to toggle those actions (example pawn card in intrigue or courtier)

viewing the trash sucks

when select card effect happens, the UI needs to remove the play all treasure cards button

when player disconnects in game, give option to kick, or continue playing

you rewrote shuffle deck effect handler to edit in place (and move card effect handler as well) - test card effects that invoke a shuffle and see if you don't need to reassign deck/discard each time now
	- also because of this maybe look into not yielding a shuffle during effects, and just let the effect handler's shuffle as needed instead
